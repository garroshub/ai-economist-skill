## 🧠 Philosophy: Beyond the Black Box

Most AI applications in finance fail because they treat LLMs as unconstrained "black box" predictors. This project presents a different approach: **Structural AI Integration.**

Instead of making blind guesses, this AI Agent operates within strictly defined macroeconomic guardrails. The key insight is simple:

> **AI's value is a multiplier of domain knowledge.**  
> Without a solid understanding of models like the Taylor Rule or Dynamic Factor Models, it is difficult to build a serious and interpretable forecasting system using AI alone.

By anchoring LLMs within established economic frameworks, we produce assessments that align with institutional consensus while maintaining the speed and adaptability of an AI Agent.

## 📊 Modules

### 1. Model-Implied Policy Rate (Taylor Rule Framework)

A Bayesian Taylor Rule framework that calculates the "neutral" vs "restrictive" stance of the Federal Reserve and Bank of Canada.

**Structural Base:**
- Non-linear Taylor Rule with asymmetric reaction coefficients for high-inflation regimes
- Multiple output gap estimators: Okun's Law, HP Filter, Capacity Utilization

**AI Bayesian Layer:**
- Performs **Counterfactual Inference** by mapping the actual rate against the model's 95% confidence interval
- Calculates Z-scores to identify "Low-Entropy" states vs "Tail-Risk" premiums
- Provides probabilistic interpretation of policy stance

### 2. GDPCastNow (Dynamic Factor Model)

A real-time GDP growth tracking engine combining traditional econometrics with AI enhancement.

**Structural Base:**
- **Bridge Equations** using high-frequency indicators (Industrial Production, Retail Sales, Payrolls)
- **SVD (Singular Value Decomposition)** to extract latent factors from "ragged-edge" data
- AR(1) nowcasting for missing observations

**AI Enhancement Layer:**
- Real-time sentiment alpha correction from newsflow (Fed/BoC communications)
- StatCan official outlook integration for Canada
- Bayesian trend anchor (shrinkage filter) for volatility dampening

## 📈 Backtest & Validation

### Model-Implied Policy Rate: Institutional Comparison

The policy rate assessments produced by this framework are broadly consistent with the consensus views of institutional economists.

*Left: Our Taylor Rule model output. Right: Real forecasts from major financial institutions (Bloomberg survey).*

#### Bank of Canada Analysis Example

**Policy Stance:** Neutral | **Deviation:** -10 bps

| Macro State | Value |
|-------------|-------|
| Core Inflation | 2.40% |
| Output Gap | -1.00% (BoC Extended Filter) |
| Current Policy Rate | 2.25% |
| Model-Implied Rate | 2.35% |

**AI Bayesian Inference:**
- **95% Confidence Interval:** [1.85%, 2.85%]
- **Z-Score:** ≈ -0.2 (center of distribution)
- **Interpretation:** The observed rate sits at the highest probability density region. Bayesian updating indicates high model credibility—rates are likely to oscillate within a narrow band around the current level.

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Taylor Rule Implementation

The non-linear Taylor Rule with asymmetric preferences:

```
i = r* + π + 0.5(π - π*) + 1.0(gap)           [Standard 1999]
i = r* + π + 0.5 × k(π - π*) + 1.0(gap)       [Non-linear, k=1.5 if π > 2.5%]
```

### SVD Factor Extraction

For the Dynamic Factor Model:
1. Standardize all indicator series
2. Apply SVD: `X = UΣV'`
3. Extract first principal component: `Factor = U[:,0] × Σ[0]`
4. Bridge to quarterly GDP via OLS

### Data Sources
- **FRED API**: US macro indicators, Canadian cross-listed series
- **BLS**: Real-time unemployment data
- **Bank of Canada**: Policy rate, neutral rate estimates, output gap
- **StatCan**: Official GDP flash estimates
